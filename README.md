# Miniproject
1. File **AB7 phase binary colloidal crystal diffussion behavior_corrected.ipynb** is used to analysed the diffusion behavior of channel particles in colloidal crystals
2. From that file, we get several figures shown in jupyter notebook as results. 
3. Besides, there are two text files are final position files, which we can visuallize in **injavis** using command:

>java -jar injavis.jar AB7_0.70_1x1x5_rho_0.64_finalDensity.pos
